        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>It is a typical winter dish and can be made with many different ingredients</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Ham</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes. Dice and cook in salted water until they can be easily pierced with a fork but are not falling apart.</li>
                <li>Combine potatoes with eggs, Parmigiano and milk. Mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Press about 60% of the potato mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan.</li>
                <li>Layer the prosciutto and scamorza inside, making two alternating layers of each and cover with more mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake at 350Â°F for approximately one hour, until golden, adding the rosemary sprig to the top of the sformato after about 20 minutes of baking.</li>
